## Frame

<div>

The `Frame` is a basic container for layout, styling, animation and events. It’s essentially a `div` element with extra options and smart defaults. Here, you see how easy it is to add visual properties, like `background` and `radius`. Plus, we include shorthand properties that make it easier to quickly customize elements, like `size`, which sets both `width` and `height`.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/62km0298rk"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame size={150} background={"#fff"} radius={20} />
  )
}
```

---

## Stack

<div>

Stacks help you easily create flexible and automatically distributed layouts with Frames.
It’s based on a `Frame`, which means it supports all Frame properties. In this example, we’re displaying a set of Frames. Notice how Stack handles the layout. It’s very easy to customize too: try setting `direction` to `"vertical"`, and notice how all Frames adapt.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/o9y86o898q"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-10)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, Stack } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Stack size={150} gap={10} direction={"horizontal"}>
      <Frame size={40} background={"#fff"} radius={40} />
      <Frame size={40} background={"#fff"} radius={40} />
      <Frame size={40} background={"#fff"} radius={40} />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

## Animate

<div>

Here, we’re animating the `rotate` property of a `Frame`.
Then, we’re using the `animate` property to set a new `rotate` property.
With the `transition` property, we can customize the animation options, like set a custom `duration` of 5 seconds.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/ykppk6k3wv"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-9)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
      transition={{ duration: 1 }}
    />
  )
}
```

---

### Loop

<div>

The `transition` property includes a number of properties that allow you to customize the animation.
In this example, we’ll create an infinitely looping animation.
Here, we’re setting the `loop` property to `Infinity`, and the `ease` to `linear`, for a perfectly looping animation. This is useful for designing progress indicators, like spinners.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/wqz8n1wk05"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-13)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
      transition={{
        duration: 2,
        loop: Infinity,
        ease: "linear",
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

---

### Cycle

<div>

You can cycle through animations with the `useCycle` method from Framer.
Here, we’re cycling between 2 sets of properties on every tap.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/xl7nmv46wq"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5-8, 10)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useCycle } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const [animate, cycle] = useCycle(
    { scale: 1.5, rotate: 0 },
    { scale: 1.0, rotate: 45 }
  )

  return <Frame animate={animate} onTap={cycle} />
}
```

---

### Color

<div>

Color strings can also be animated by using the `background` property. In this example, we’re infinitely animating from light blue to purple and back again (by using the `yoyo` property and setting it to `Infinity`) with a `duration` of 1 second.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/vv8ll0pmk7"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-13)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      animate={{ background: "#85F" }}
      transition={{
        duration: 1,
        yoyo: Infinity,
      }}
      background={"#0CF"}
    />
  )
}
```

---

### Arrays

<div>

Next to single values, you can also animate arrays of values within the `animate` property. In this example, we’re infinitely animating between three different colors (by using the `yoyo` property and setting it to `Infinity`) with a `duration` of 2 seconds.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/o4j24j2zmq"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-13)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      animate={{ background: ["#F05", "#85F", "#0CF"] }}
      transition={{
        duration: 2,
        yoyo: Infinity,
      }}
      background={"#0CF"}
    />
  )
}
```

---

## Gestures

<div>

Let’s start by simply animating a `Frame` when tapping on it.
We’ll create two constants, a default `rotate` value of `0` and a `setState` method.

Then, a new function that takes the `rotate` value, and adds `90` to it every time.
Finally, we’ll pass along `rotate` to the `animate` property, and the `toggleRotate` method to `onTap`.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/jlq97yryk9"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 6-7, 9)
import * as React from "react"
import { useState } from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const [rotate, setRotate] = useState(0)
  const toggleRotate = () => setRotate(rotate + 90)

  return <Frame animate={{ rotate }} onTap={toggleRotate} />
}
```

---

### On Hover

<div>

Now, let’s simply scale down a `Frame` when hovering it.
We can use the `whileHover` property, and pass along a property an its value.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/8zoqqj2x2j"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(5)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Frame whileHover={{ scale: 0.75 }} />
}
```

---

## Dragging

You can easily make any `Frame` draggable with the `drag` property. It can be set to control the drag axis using `"x"` or `"y"`. It can also be dragged in any direction by setting it to `true`.

```jsx highlight(5)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Frame drag={true} />
}
```

---

### Constraints

<div>

To add `contraints` and limit the drag area, you can include the `dragConstraints` property.
Pass along an object with `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` values to define the dragging region.

The values are measured relatively to the current object, so if you wanted to allow for `100` pixels of dragging to the left side of a `Frame`, you would have to add `left: -100`.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/53mv19r5r4"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(6-14)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      drag={true}
      dragConstraints={{
        left: -100,
        right: 100,
        top: -100,
        bottom: 100,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

---

## Scrolling

<div>

For scrolling, you can wrap Frames in a `Scroll` component, to make them automatically scrollable. Make sure the Frame or collection of Frames together exceed either the width or the height of the `Scroll` component. Scrolling direction is set to `"vertical"` by default. The content size is automatically calculated.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/zqk53xj9k3"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 6-10)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, Scroll } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Scroll height={150}>
      <Frame height={70} />
      <Frame height={70} top={80} />
      <Frame height={70} top={160} />
    </Scroll>
  )
}
```

---

## Paging

<div>

For paging, you can wrap Frames in a `Page` component to make them swipeable. Optionally, custom transition properties can be provided. Swipe direction is set to `"horizontal"` by default. The content size is automatically calculated.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/88j3049zr9"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 6-10)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, Page } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Page>
      <Frame />
      <Frame />
      <Frame />
    </Page>
  )
}
```

---

## Transforms

<div>

Here, we’re using two custom Hooks in Framer to transform values from one range to another.
The `useMotionValue` provides an animatable and sharable value, which we’ll use for the `x` position.
Then, we’ll transform that value from a range of `[-200, 200]` to a range that makes sense for `scale`.
Finally, we’ll apply both properties to the `Frame`.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/l0061n7v7"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5-6, 8)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useMotionValue, useTransform } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const x = useMotionValue(0)
  const scale = useTransform(x, [-200, 200], [1.5, 0.5])

  return <Frame drag={"x"} x={x} scale={scale} />
}
```

---

## Variants

<div>

Variants are collections of visual properties, like states, that you can animate or cycle between.
For example, buttons usually have a hover state next to their default state.
On hover, perhaps the `background` and `boxShadow` are changed.
These properties can be defined in `variants`.

First, we’re defining the variants, which are essentially collections of visual properties. In this case, they’ll each contain a `scale` and a `rotate` value. We’ll call them `variantA` and `variantB` respectively.

Finally, we’re referencing the properties using the `variants` property, and animating to `variantB` on hover with the `whileHover` property.

<Button
  name="Open Example"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/98vm5qo84"
/>

</div>

```jsx highlight(5-8, 11-15)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const variants = {
    variantA: { scale: 0.75, rotate: 0 },
    variantB: { scale: 1.0, rotate: 90 },
  }

  return (
    <Frame
      initial={"variantA"}
      whileHover={"variantB"}
      variants={variants}
    />
  )
}
```
