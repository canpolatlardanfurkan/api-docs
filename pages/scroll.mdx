# Scroll

<span className="lead">
  Create scrollable areas for desktop or mobile, with mouse
  and touch-based input support.
</span>

<div>

The Scroll Component is based on a `Frame`, which means that it supports **all Frame properties**. It allows you to create scrollable areas. Add Frames that exceed either the `height` or `width` of the component to create horizontally or vertically scrollable areas.

- Create horizontally or vertically scrollable areas
- Create nestable scrolling areas
- Use touch wheels for desktop scrolling
- Advanced control with momentum and overdrag

The Scroll Component is **not** just a `div` with `overflow: scroll`, but uses custom real physics (friction and spring) to mimic iOS-like scrolling. It works on all platforms and you have full control over the inputs and all events. This allows you to explore new and custom scroll based interactions.

</div>

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, Scroll } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Scroll size={200}>
      <Frame size={300}>Hello World!</Frame>
    </Scroll>
  )
}
```

## Sizing

Internally, the Scroll Component wraps all your `children` in a Frame and offsets the position based on your scrolling. For that to work, it needs to be able to calculate the total size of your scroll contents.

It attempts to do so automatically by measuring your added children in the dom using a [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver). If that is unavailable, it will use a polyfill. If you use `contentWidth` and `contentHeight` it will opt out of this behaviour. You can use this if you need to performantly animate your scroll content size.
