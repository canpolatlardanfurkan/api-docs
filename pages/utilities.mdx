## Transform

<APIFunction name="(transform:function)" />

---

### Ranges

<div>

The `transform` method also supports ranges of more than 2 numbers. Given an input range of `[-200, -100, 100, 200]` and an output range of `[0, 1, 1, 0]`, this function will:

- If input is between `-200` and `-100`, return a value between `0` and `1`
- If input is between `-100` and `100`, return `1`
- If input is between `100` and `200`, return a value between `1` and `0`

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5-9)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, transform } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const inputRange = [-200, -100, 100, 200]
  const outputRange = [0, 1, 1, 0]
  const output = transform(150, inputRange, outputRange)
  // output equals 0.5
  return <Frame>{output}</Frame>
}
```

## useTransform

<APIFunction name="useTransform()" />

### Transforming Ranges

<div>

You can also use this hook to convert ranges of numeric values based on user input.
In this example, we `Frame` that is horizontally draggable.

The `x` value starts at `0`, and we’re converting the horizontal movement of the `Frame` from `0 - 200` into `1 - 0.5`, a range that is acceptable for `scale`. Both the `x` and the `scale` values then get set on the `Frame`, too.

</div>

```jsx highlight(2-6, 9-10, 12)
import * as React from "react"
import {
  Frame,
  useMotionValue,
  useTransformedValue,
} from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const x = useMotionValue(0)
  const scale = useTransformedValue(x, [0, 200], [1, 0.5])

  return <Frame drag={"x"} x={x} scale={scale} />
}
```

## useAnimation

<APIFunction name="useAnimation()" />

---

### Sequence

<div>

Animations can be sequenced using `async` functions, allowing you to chain animations with different sets of properties. The `start` method returns a `Promise`.

In this example, we’re moving a `Frame` four times in a row on every single tap, passing in unique properties after every previous animation has been completed.

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5, 7-12, 14)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useAnimation } from "framer"

export function MyComponent(props) {
  const animation = useAnimation()

  async function sequence() {
    await animation.start({ left: 100 })
    await animation.start({ top: 100 })
    await animation.start({ left: 0 })
    await animation.start({ top: 0 })
  }

  return <Frame animate={animation} onTap={sequence} />
}
```

---

### Dynamic Start

<div>

A function can be passed to `start` to return a different set of animation settings for every animating component. Each component will provide the function with its properties.

In this example, we’re passing along the `i` parameter, which we set on the components manually. It’s used to create unique delays for each `Frame`, which will be `0.5` for the first component, and `1` for the second. This effectively creates a controlled staggered animation.

Finally, we’re adding some default visual properties like `opacity`, `size` and `background` that allow us to visualize the effect.

</div>

```javascript highlight(2, 5, 7-10, 13-28)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useAnimation } from "framer"

export function MyComponent(props) {
  const animation = useAnimation()

  animation.start(({ i }) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { delay: i * 0.5 },
  }))

  return (
    <Frame background="#09F">
      <Frame
        i={0}
        opacity={0}
        animate={animation}
        size={50}
        background={"rgba(255,255,255,0.5)"}
      />
      <Frame
        i={1}
        opacity={0}
        animate={animation}
        size={50}
        background={"rgba(255,255,255,0.25)"}
      />
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

---

### Variants

The `useAnimation` function can optionally accept variants, and can be referenced later by `start`.

```jsx
const animation = useAnimation({
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
})

animation.start("visible")
```

---

### Stopping Animations

All currently active animations can be stopped with `animation.stop()`.

```jsx
animation.stop()
```

---

## useCycle

<APIFunction name="useCycle()" />

---

### Cycle with Animate

Cycle can also be used with the `animate` property.
Here we’re passing along objects with multiple properties, instead of single property.
Then, instead of referencing a specific property on `animate`, we’re just referencing the object, and cycling between the states with `cycleAnimate`.

```jsx highlight(2, 5-8, 10)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useCycle } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const [animate, cycle] = useCycle([
    { rotate: 90, scale: 0.5 },
    { rotate: 0, scale: 1 },
  ])

  return <Frame animate={animate} onTap={() => cycle()} />
}
```

---

### Change Initial State

By default, the initial state is the first item in the provided array.
By passing a different index as the second argument, `useCycle` can start on a different item in the array. Please note that the `index` value of an array starts at `0`.

```jsx highlight(2, 5-6,8)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useCycle } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  // Start x at 100
  const [x, cycleX] = useCycle([0, 50, 100], 2)

  return <Frame animate={{ x }} onClick={() => cycleX()} />
}
```

---

### Cycle to a Specific State

<div>

The returned `cycleState` function, by default, cycles to the next item in the provided array.
Optionally, it accepts an index that will cycle to a specific item in the array.
In this example, we’ve used `variants` and passed along the names of each variant, instead of directly including the properties.

Here, it will always cycle to the `off` state, because we’ve passed along the index of `0` to the `cycleToggle` function. If we were to remove it, it would cycle between `off` and `on` again.

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5-8, 10, 13-17)
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame, useCycle } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  const variants = {
    off: { opacity: 0.5 },
    on: { opacity: 1.0 },
  }

  const [toggle, cycleToggle] = useCycle(["off", "on"], 1)

  return (
    <Frame
      variants={variants}
      animate={toggle}
      onClick={() => cycleVariant(0)}
    />
  )
}
```
